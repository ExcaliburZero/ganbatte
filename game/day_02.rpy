    h "Kosuke and Misaki exchange a glance and shrug. My encounter with the strange girl over, we resume shopping."

    h "We stop at a stand selling Vocaloid merchandise. Kosuke buys chibi figures of Rin and Len Kagamine, and he buys me a chibi figure of Megurine Luka. Before I can stop her, Misaki buys me a chibi figure of Gumi, asserting that if Kosuke can buy me a figure she should be able to as well."

    h "I feel a little guilty letting them buy these gifts for me, but they insist that they are happy to do so."

    h "Finally, we stop at Ashiteru Hon, the only place in the market that we have not spent time at yet."

    momoko "Umm....hmmm...I’ll take Titus Andronicus, The Iliad, The Silmarillion, and...umm...Finnegan’s Wake. Tehe, that’s four books~!"

    "She breaks into childish giggles and I seriously wonder if she can comprehend even a sentence from even one of the books she selected. Even so, she pays for the books and takes all four of them. When she turns to leave the stand, she notices us and giggles again."

    momoko "Oh, Hi~!"

    "For someone who I have never met before, she’s surprisingly friendly. I guess she does not just look childish, she has the practical intelligence of one."

    haruki "Hello."

    momoko "Tehe, I love books~! Do you love books too?"

    haruki "Um, yes, I do."

    "Her entire face lights up, and she begins to bounce up and down excitedly."
