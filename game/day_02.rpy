    kosuke "Haruki-kun~!!!!"

    "The voice comes from somewhere in the inky blackness. Somewhere far away."

    misaki "Hey, time to wake up~!!!"

    "Another voice, almost certainly Misaki’s."

    kosuke "If you don’t wake up, we’re going to be late!"

    misaki "Hey! Don’t you want to see me in my adorable uniform, Haruki-kun!?!?"

    kosuke "Maybe you should give him a kiss to wake him up, like Sleeping Beauty!"

    #sound slap

    misaki "Why don’t you give him a kiss, idiot?"

    kosuke "Maybe I will!"

    misaki "Wait, you aren’t actually going to do it, are you!?!"

    kosuke "Maybe I will!"

    misaki "No! If anyone gets to kiss Haruki-kun while he’s sleeping, it’s going to be me!!!"

    "I am fully conscious now, and I’ve decided that this has gone far enough."

    "I gasp, nearly hitting my head on Kosuke and Misaki, both of whom are leaning over my face. They appear not to have realized I have awoken as both are currently pushing and shoving each other in an attempt to be closer to me."

    haruki "Good morning..."

    "They both immediately stop fighting and look embarrassed."

    #show kosuke uniform embarrassed
    #show misaki uniform embarrassed

    misaki "G-good morning, Haruki-kun! I came here to wake you up so I would be the first face you saw when you woke up!"

    "She mutters something else, but I can only make out the word “future”."

    #show kosuke uniform smirk

    kosuke "Actually, I was the one who came here to get you. She just tagged along."

    #show misaki uniform angry

    misaki "Not true!"

    #show kosuke uniform angry

    kosuke "Yes it is!!!"

    "I laugh. Will they ever stop fighting over me? Evidently not. I get out of bed, stretching and yawning."

    haruki "How long until we have to be at work?"

    misaki "A half hour!"

    kosuke "Yup. So you should probably get changed. We’ll leave so you can do that."

    #show kosuke uniform smirk

    kosuke "Unless Misaki wants to stay and watch."

    "I feel the blush immediately. Why does he keep saying things like that?"

    "I laugh awkwardly, and the two leave shutting the door behind them."

    "I quickly open the closet and change into the first outfit I can find. It does not really matter what I wear, of course, if I get a job I’ll just have to change into the uniform anyway."

    #screen kasai house inside

    "Fully changed I exit my room, joining Misaki and Kosuke at the breakfast table. They are eating okayu, and another bowl of it sits in the seat between the two of them. I assume it is for me."

    "The three of us eat quickly, eager to get to the café. When we are finished eating, we clean off our dishes and head towards the door."

    "Mr. Kasai hands us each a bag of onigiri on our way out the door."

    mrKasai "Here, for lunch today! I packed you a kamaboko, Haruki-kun, for good luck!"

    #show kosuke uniform normal

    mrKasai "That’s alright, just don’t stay out too late. And remember to have fun!"

    haruki "Thanks, Kasai-san! Thank you again for letting me stay here, too!"

    kosuke "It’s our pleasure! You’re practically our favorite child!"

    "As we walk, we talk more about Kosuke and Misaki’s parents."

    haruki "So, what does your mom do for a living?"

    kosuke "Mom? She works at a medical research company based in Maura. They’ve developed cures for all sorts of things! And mom’s the head researcher!"

    haruki "Wow, that’s really impressive! That’s why you moved out here, right?"

    misaki "Right, Haruki-kun~! Mom’s company relocated and promised her the promotion if she moved with it!"

    "Now that I think about it, I do remember her telling my mother something like that right before the Kasai family moved."

    haruki "Wow, you must be pretty proud of her!"

    #show kosuke uniform beaming

    kosuke "I am! It’s my hope that one day..."

    #show kosuke uniform upset

    kosuke "She’ll develop a cure for Kokona-chan."

    "I am surprised by his sudden change in expression and the sudden gravity of his tone. Wasn’t Kokona the name of the coworker he mentioned? Why does she need a cure?"

    haruki "Kokona-chan? Why does she need a cure?"

    kosuke "Oh it’s um...well...she’s...uh..."

    #show misaki uniform upset

    misaki "We really don’t like talking about it."

    haruki "Oh...sorry..."

    "They both seem close to tears and I wonder why."

    misaki "Besides, Kokona should tell you herself if she wants to."

    haruki "Sorry again for asking about it..."

    kosuke "It’s fine, I shouldn’t have mentioned it."

    h "What could it be about her that she needs a cure?"

    h "Despite my lingering questions, I know that inquiring further will do nothing for me other than make Kosuke and Misaki more upset. So I revert the conversation back to its original subject."

    #show kosuke uniform normal

    kosuke "Dad? No, not really. He’s never really been the office type. He’s pretty much just a homemaker but he has an online specialty bento business. He’s really good at making themed bento."

    haruki "Wow, really?"

    #show misaki uniform proud

    misaki "Yeah! And he’s teaching me! Someday I’ll have to make you a themed bento of your favorite anime!"

    "Another silence descends on our group as we walk down the crowded streets of Maura. Occasionally, Kosuke and Misaki glare at each other, but I decide not to comment on what they were saying. Or the fact that I heard everything they said in the morning. I figure that it’s for the best if neither knows that I know."

It is situated on the corner of a street, and most of the walls facing the street are taken up by large windows shaded by white and pink striped awnings."

    h "In the windows I see people of all ages eating pastries and sipping drinks. Some are reading. Reading all sorts of things. Books. Manga. Light Novels. The newspaper. Some of them are writing. Others type on laptops or talk on phones."

    h "Drink machines sit on the wall behind the counter, and workers dressed like Kosuke and Misaki mill about between the machines and the counter."
